 * @brief The people (NPC) translation unit: per-frame update, movement,
 *        turning, motions, look-at, interaction queries and open/close.
 *
 * Extent (from the retail sections):
 *   .text    0x801812C4 - 0x8018F470
 *   .rodata  0x80273F90 - 0x802741F8  (initializer images, then the log
 *                                      strings; the TU addresses the block
 *                                      from its base, so it is one object)
 *   .data    0x8036C4E8 - 0x8036C53C  (__FUNCTION__ names: peopleOpenSub,
 *                                      peopleWaitSyncMotion(Blend),
 *                                      peopleMoveCheck)
 *   .sbss    0x8047B1F0 - 0x8047B1F8  (the two shadow lights)
 *   .sdata2  0x8047D798 - 0x8047D8A8  (the literal pool; it ends with
 *                                      2500.0f plus padding)
 *
 * The TU ends at fn_8018F30C. 0x8018F470-0x8018FE30 (peopleInit, the entry
 * accessors, the info-bios getters and the save/load hooks) is a separate
 * unit: it has its own .sdata2 pool (0x8047D8A8-0x8047D8B8, repeating 0.0f,
 * 1.0f and the degree factor this pool already holds), its own .sbss
 * (0x8047B1F8-0x8047B208) and its own switch table, and this TU calls even
 * its eight-byte getters (peopleGetMaxCount) instead of inlining them.
 *
 * Build (one flag set for the whole unit): GC/2.0 -O4,p with
 * -inline noauto,deferred and -str reuse,readonly. The evidence:
 *   - GC/2.0 rather than GC/1.3 (checked 2026-09-28): every function that
 *     is exact under GC/1.3 stays exact, fn_8018D7D0 becomes exact (under
 *     GC/1.3 the masked index and the 0x7FFF0000 constant swap r0/r3; its
 *     linked carve people_candidate_8018D7D0_gc20.c was already GC/2.0),
 *     and fn_8018CD08's register differences shrink (56 -> 48 lines);
 *     GC/2.5-2.7 give the same code, GC/2.0p1 breaks 36 functions.
 *   - .text runs in the reverse of the .rodata initializer-image order and
 *     of the __FUNCTION__ order in .data, the layout MWCC's deferred mode
 *     gives a file written top-down; so the functions below appear in
 *     descending address order.
 *   - no function is auto-inlined: fn_80189990 calls the 40-byte
 *     fn_80188F78 out of line;
 *   - the log formats are in .rodata (readonly strings) while the
 *     __FUNCTION__ names are in .data.
 * The lookups and other routines the TU expands at many call sites are
 * static inline below (see game/people/people_inline.h for the evidence).
 *
 * Built this way the .sdata2 pool pairs constant for constant with retail
 * and the .rodata strings follow in retail order. Still open before the
 * unit can be linked:
 *   - retail .rodata has a sixth 12-byte zero image at 0x80273FCC, after
 *     fn_80184D80's; MWCC emits such an image for an initialized local
 *     that is never used, in some function below 0x80184D80, but nothing
 *     in the code says which, so it is not invented here (the string
 *     offsets from the block base are 12 short as a result);
 *   - fn_801821B8's copy of peopleWaitSyncMotion logs that function's own
 *     __FUNCTION__ object, which a separate static inline cannot share;
 *   - register-allocation differences in a few functions.
 *
 * Why 0x801812C4-0x80181EB0 (fn_801812C4, fn_801812E8, fn_80181478,
 * fn_80181850; all four 100%) cannot be linked as a standalone carve like
 * the people_exact_*.c pieces (checked 2026-09-28): compiled on their own
 * with this TU's flags, the four functions (with the XD-named
 * peopleMoveTypeRandomRot/peopleUpdateShadows inlines and the
 * people_inline.h lookups) give .text 0xBEC in retail order, and an .sdata2
 * of 0x40 bytes that is exactly retail 0x8047D798-0x8047D7D8: the head of
 * this TU's one deduplicated literal pool (75.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.5f, pi,
 * pi/2, 2pi as double and float, 2.0f, then the signed and unsigned
 * int-to-float magic doubles). The pieces carved so far read pool literals
 * by symbol (lbl_8047D7A0, lbl_8047D828) and emit no .sdata2, but
 * fn_80181850 converts fn_800D37CC()'s and fn_800D3088()'s results to
 * float (the random-rotation wait and the per-tick step), and MWCC emits the
 * magic constants of such conversions itself; C cannot name
 * lbl_8047D7C8/lbl_8047D7D0 for them. The object therefore has its own
 * pool. Giving the carve 0x8047D798-0x8047D7D8 does not work either: those
 * constants are local @-literals there, while the rest of the TU reads the
 * same bytes by name (people_exact_80188984.c's lbl_8047D7A0 and the
 * unlinked pieces' asm, which reference lbl_8047D798-lbl_8047D7D0), so the
 * link would lose those globals; only aliases or named stand-in constants
 * could keep them, and both are rejected. The range links with the whole
 * TU (.text 0x801812C4-0x8018F470 plus the .rodata/.data/.sbss/.sdata2
 * above as one object). That needs, besides the open items above, these
 * functions exact (report, 2026-09-28): fn_80188214 99.72% and
 * fn_8018ECEC 99.42%, both register-allocation walls; and peopleOpen
 * 99.96%, peopleOpenSub 99.99% and fn_8018CD08 99.99%, which differ only
 * in the 12-byte .rodata image above (their string offsets). Lane B30x
 * fixed peopleOpenSub's r19/r20 swap and fn_8018CD08's FPR colouring
 * (see those functions); the peopleTurnTo form that fixed the latter also
 * made fn_8018524C (99.34%) exact.
 * Pokemon XD offers no admissible helper for them under the sister-title
 * clause: no window of their wall regions scores 0.45 against
 * trevor403/xd-asm (b1087f18) with tools/find_inline_expansions.py;
 * fn_8018524C's counterpart _peopleMoveTypeList__FP13tagPeopleWorkb
 * (0x8029A0C8) was rewritten in XD; fn_80188214 is XD's peopleMoveForward
 * (0x8029C6C4) with peopleMoveAlongAngle (0x8029C194) expanded, but XD's
 * peopleMoveAlongAngle makes different calls (sin/cos,
 * GScolsys2HumanGetWalkHeight instead of fn_800E0718/GSvecTransformQuat);
 * see fn_80188214 for the helper form that is exact but not admitted.
 * (fn_80186B5C and fn_80189990 became exact on 2026-09-28, lane B30r.)
 *
 * The two data items, re-examined 2026-09-28 (lane U1):
 *   - The sixth .rodata image (0x80273FCC). The images belong to
 *     fn_8018E920 (0x80273F90, the three bios callbacks), fn_8018CD08
 *     (0x80273F9C, read as base+0xC), fn_80188214 (0x80273FA8),
 *     fn_80186B5C (0x80273FB4) and fn_80184D80 (0x80273FC0); nothing in the
 *     TU reads 0x80273FCC, by symbol or as an offset from another base.
 *     GC/1.3 creates a local's initializer image when it parses the
 *     definition, so the images follow source order, and it keeps the
 *     image when the local is never read: controlled tests give an
 *     unreferenced image for a local that is never used, for one that is
 *     only written, and for a static inline that is never called; any
 *     read, even a conditional one, copies the image. So retail has one
 *     such local (or uncalled inline, or dead-stripped function) somewhere
 *     after fn_80184D80 in the source, and the code cannot say where.
 *     Pokemon XD does not help: its versions of these functions
 *     (_peopleMoveTypeRandomWalk 0x80299E54 and the rest of the TU) were
 *     rewritten without Vec images (xd-asm b1087f18), and no XD disc is
 *     available for its .rodata. An invented unused local or stand-in
 *     function is rejected, so the image stays open.
 *     Re-examined 2026-09-28 (lane B30d):
 *     . An unused local keeps no stack slot and changes no instruction
 *       (controlled GC/1.3 and GC/2.0 tests, also inside an expanded static
 *       inline), so no retail frame or code can point at its function.
 *     . The Pokemon XD JP demo's linker map (NXXJ01.map,
 *       StarsMmd/Colo-XD-PBR-symbol-maps 6b51d3af) lists people.o's live
 *       and stripped ("UNUSED") functions in object order, and its live
 *       ones run in exactly this TU's address order (_peopleDoNeckUpdate =
 *       fn_801812C4, peopleWalkPauseTalkMode = fn_801812E8,
 *       peopleWalkPause = fn_80181478, peopleDaemon = fn_80181850,
 *       peopleDispMark = fn_80181EB0, peopleFallAppear = fn_801821B8, ...,
 *       _peopleMoveTypeRandomWalk = fn_80184D80, _peopleMoveTypeList =
 *       fn_8018524C, _peopleMoveTypeLinear = fn_801858C4, _peopleMoveSub =
 *       fn_80185AAC, peopleUpdateAnimation = fn_80185B90). The image must
 *       come from below fn_80184D80 in that order. The stripped functions
 *       there are peopleSetHeroMove (8 bytes, before _peopleDoNeckUpdate)
 *       and peopleRandomWalkPause (0xA4, between peopleWalkPause and
 *       peopleUpdateShadow), which makes peopleRandomWalkPause the likeliest
 *       owner. The map's other stripped movers (_peopleWillMove,
 *       peopleMoveVector, peopleGetPosXYZ) sit above
 *       _peopleMoveTypeRandomWalk, so their images would come before
 *       fn_80184D80's. peopleRandomWalkPause has no body anywhere: it is
 *       UNUSED in the demo and absent from XD retail (TeamOrre/xd-decomp
 *       GXXE01 symbols.txt, trevor403/xd-asm). XD retail's
 *       peopleUpdateShadow (0x80298768) and peopleSetSpeedRate (0x802996B0),
 *       which Colosseum lacks in the same range, have no Vec local. So there
 *       is a likely owner but no body to reconstruct.
 *     . Not applied (a judgement call): an unused `GSvec offset = {0.0f,
 *       0.0f, 0.0f};` in peopleMoveTypeRandomRot, whose waiting code is
 *       fn_80184D80's (which has that local), puts the image at 0x80273FCC.
 *       fn_80181850 stays exact, peopleOpen becomes exact and the string
 *       offsets in fn_8018CD08/peopleOpenSub pair. But nothing shows that
 *       RandomRot had that local, and the NXXJ01.map ordering points at
 *       another function.
 *   - peopleWaitSyncMotion's __FUNCTION__ (.data 0x8036C4F8) is read by
 *     both peopleWaitSyncMotion (0x8018B1DC) and fn_801821B8 (0x80182D58),
 *     so retail expands the global function itself inside fn_801821B8.
 *     fn_8018D998 and peopleSearchID are likewise the out-of-line copies
 *     of the peopleFindSelf/peopleFindBySelf expansions. GC/1.3-2.6 in C
 *     mode give that shape (one __FUNCTION__ object, global function plus
 *     an expansion) only with -inline auto, and -inline auto,deferred (or
 *     all,deferred) on this TU leaves peopleWaitSyncMotion out of line in
 *     fn_801821B8 (0xD28 bytes, retail 0xE60) while wrongly expanding
 *     fn_80185AAC in fn_80184D80/fn_801858C4 and fn_801845E4 in
 *     fn_80181EB0. An explicit `inline` definition is expanded but not
 *     emitted out of line (its __FUNCTION__ becomes a weak
 *     __FUNCTION__$localstatic1$ object) unless its address is taken, and
 *     nothing in the TU takes it. No flag set or natural source found
 *     gives both.
 *     Re-examined 2026-09-28 (lane B30d): the GC/1.3 result above is
 *     specific to GC/1.3's auto-inline size limit. GC/1.3.2, GC/2.0 and
 *     later use a different size measure: about 30 simple statements
 *     against about 15 for GC/1.3, and it is measured before the callee's
 *     own explicit inlines expand. It has no per-caller budget and no
 *     definition-order effect under deferred. With that measure, and with
 *     fn_801821B8 calling the global peopleWaitSyncMotion (the static inline
 *     peopleSyncMotionWait removed), GC/2.0 -inline auto,deferred (the
 *     other flags unchanged) reproduces retail's decisions: fn_801821B8 is
 *     identical to retail (0xE60, peopleWaitSyncMotion expanded), .data
 *     holds exactly four __FUNCTION__ objects in retail order (peopleOpenSub,
 *     peopleWaitSyncMotion, ...Blend, peopleMoveCheck), and fn_80185AAC,
 *     fn_80188F78 and fn_80188FA0 stay out of line as in retail. Every
 *     other function is unchanged except two expansions retail does not
 *     make: fn_801845E4 into fn_80181EB0 (both calls) and fn_8018F30C into
 *     fn_80181850 (0x774 bytes, retail 0x660). Both are just under the
 *     limit. One extra store statement puts fn_801845E4 over it, two extra
 *     calls do, and three extra calls put fn_8018F30C over it. Nothing
 *     evidences a larger source form for either, and restating them only to
 *     cross the limit would be shaping. `-inline level=2` keeps fn_801845E4
 *     out of line but refuses depth-3 expansions retail makes, and cannot
 *     stop fn_8018F30C (depth 2, as deep as peopleWaitSyncMotion's).
 *     -inline auto therefore stays off. Its evidence is recorded here: it
 *     is the only mechanism found for the shared __FUNCTION__ object.
 * fn_8018D7D0 was not exact under GC/1.3 (retail computes
 * (index & 0x7FFF0000) in r3 and the constant in r0, GC/1.3 swaps them);
 * it is exact since the unit moved to GC/2.0 (above).
