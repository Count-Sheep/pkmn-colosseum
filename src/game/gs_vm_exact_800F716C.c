 *
 * Address range: 0x800F716C - 0x800F7274 (fn_800F716C).
 *
 * A .text-only piece of the GS VM translation unit (game/gs_vm.c holds the
 * same definition). It does not read the string pool, so the unit is exact
 * on its own with the manager pointer extern.

/* 0x800F716C | 0x108: stop every script running on a thread of `group`
 * (the thread's +0x0C field, read by fn_800F0374; floor teardown passes
 * the floor id).
 * The thread's group is read into its own variable before the compare:
 * retail compares "cmplw r3,r30" (the group read, then the argument).
 * MWCC (GC/1.3 through 2.7, -O4,p/-O4,s/-O3/-O2) turns an integer equality
 * with a call on either side, fn_800F0374(t) == group or
 * group == fn_800F0374(t), into "cmplw r30,r3"; the call-first order only
 * comes out when the call's value is a named variable (or when both sides
 * are pointers, as in fight_target.c's (void*)fightTrainerGetStatus(...)
 * == (void*)target, which is not the case for a floor id). */
