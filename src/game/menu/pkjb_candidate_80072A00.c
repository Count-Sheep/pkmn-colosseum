 *
 * fn_80072A00: command 0x60, then ping with 0xAA until the GBA answers
 * (3 s), with the key state held.
 *
 * The earlier pkjbWait60 inline form was 99.7%: the key channel and the
 * result swapped callee-saved registers, because the inline's GBAWrite
 * result became a frontend split temp numbered above key (lane D9/D16
 * replays). Retail keeps the result in the caller: the first reset call
 * has its own temporary, and the 3 s ping loop writes the timeout code
 * through a pointer to the caller's result. With result a caller local
 * declared after key, key is coloured first (r29, result r28), and the
 * loop's locals keep their inline numbering (lane D28).
 * Unit flags and shared helpers: see game/menu/pkjb_uploader_shared.h.
