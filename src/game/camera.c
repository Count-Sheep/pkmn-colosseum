/**
 * @file camera.c
 * @brief The scene camera: state, target/offset animation, timed moves,
 *        pad-driven debug cameras, per-floor defaults and save state.
 *
 * Whole-TU source. Linked (2026-10-03) through camera_801765F4.c, which
 * defines CAMERA_801765F4_ONLY and owns .text 0x801765F4-0x80179DFC (every
 * function up to and including cameraInit), cameraInit's .rodata image
 * 0x80273D98-0x80273DC8, all of .data and the whole .sdata2 pool. The
 * save-state handlers after it link from camera_exact_80179DFC.c and
 * camera_candidate_80179E04.c. In that build the state block and its
 * pointers are extern (their data units own them), and two .rodata objects
 * that retail places after the stripped cameraDispInfo's strings (the zero
 * vector at 0x80273DC8 and the cameraWaitSyncAnime message at 0x80273F34)
 * are read through extern names, a listed rule exception. The notes below
 * on the remaining .rodata gap and the blocker statement are the record
 * that this link resolves for every section except that .rodata tail.
 *
 * TU extent (text and data):
 *   .text   0x801765F4-0x80179F4C  fn_801765F4 .. _cameraRestoreStateData;
 *                                  gs_spline.c ends at 0x801765F4, the
 *                                  unoptimised fn_80179F4C after it is not
 *                                  camera code (gs_range_80179F4C.c)
 *   .rodata 0x80273D98-0x80273F70  cameraInit's initialisers, zero vectors,
 *                                  15 debug strings, the
 *                                  cameraWaitSyncAnime message; fsys'
 *                                  "gsfsys.toc" starts at 0x80273F70
 *   .data   0x8036C248-0x8036C29C  the up vector, then cameraUpdate's two
 *                                  switch tables
 *   .bss    0x80452EC8-0x80452FC8  the camera state
 *   .sdata  0x80478C40-0x80478C48  the state pointer (+pad)
 *   .sbss   0x8047B1A8-0x8047B1B0  the floor-entry table and its handle
 *   .sdata2 0x8047D720-0x8047D790  30.0f and 1.0f, then the float pool
 *
 * The file is written in reverse address order and built with
 * -inline auto,deferred: MWCC then emits the functions back in retail order
 * and inlines the camera's own setters wherever retail expands them
 * (cameraReturn is GSscene_SetMode, cameraSetHeight/Distance/Fov,
 * cameraMoveTarget, cameraMoveRotationXYZ and cameraMoveEndCheck inlined).
 * The unit flags are GC/1.3.2 (cameraInit's initialiser copy loads all
 * twelve words before storing, which GC/1.3 does not do), -inline
 * auto,deferred and -str reuse,readonly (the strings live in .rodata); no
 * local pragmas.
 *
 * Recomp status (user decision, 2026-09-28): the recomp ports this unit
 * natively and row 43 is cleared as a decomp blocker; the decomp returns to
 * linking it later. The findings below are what that work starts from.
 *
 * Why the whole TU (with all of its .rodata) does not link:
 * - .rodata: retail keeps 15 debug strings ("TargetFollow" .. "Far Z:(%.2f)",
 *   0x80273DF8-0x80273F34) and three zero vectors (0x80273DD4-0x80273DF8)
 *   from a function the linker stripped. Nothing here produces them, so the
 *   unit's .rodata is 0x160 bytes short in the middle of the range (0x77 of
 *   0x1D8 bytes); every other section is byte-identical up to end padding.
 *   The function is cameraDispInfo (lane B43, 2026-09-28): the Pokemon XD
 *   JP demo's linker map (NXXJ01 Master.MAP, published as NXXJ01.map in
 *   StarsMmd/Colo-XD-PBR-symbol-maps 6b51d3af) lists in camera.o
 *   "UNUSED 0x3EC cameraDispInfo", placed right after cameraSetMirrorFlag
 *   (our fn_801765F4) and cameraGetAddSize, and its .rodata as 15 UNUSED
 *   strings @2606, @2614, @2617..@2629 whose sizes (0xD, 0xD, 0xC, 0x19,
 *   0x1B, 0xF, 0xF, 0x15, 0x1B, 0x1D, 0x1B, 0x15, 0xE, 0xE, 0xD) are exactly
 *   these 15 strings in this order; the seven short type names between
 *   "TargetFollow" and "Offset Anime" (@2607..@2613) are .sdata2 strings and
 *   the 9-entry name table (@2630, 0x24) is in .data. Its code is stripped
 *   in every known build (XD demo, XD retail, this one), so no source gives
 *   its body: a reconstruction would be guessed code, and it stays out.
 *   The survival itself is natural. Controlled test with this unit's
 *   compiler and flags and the project linker (GC/1.2.5n): MWCC emits the
 *   strings and initializer images of an uncalled global (and of an
 *   unreferenced plain static; a static inline emits nothing); mwld then
 *   strips them object by object, unless a live function in the same object
 *   addresses .rodata from its section symbol "...rodata.0". cameraInit
 *   does exactly that (lbl_80273D98 = this unit's first .rodata byte, then
 *   offsets), so the whole .rodata section, the stripped function's strings
 *   and zero images included, is kept, while its code, a .data table and
 *   .sdata2 names are stripped. A research shape (three zero-initialized
 *   GSSceneVec3 locals, a static 9-name table, the 13 format strings in
 *   order, placed just above fn_801765F4) makes this unit's .rodata
 *   byte-identical to retail apart from the relocated handler words; it is
 *   not committed because its body is not evidenced.
 * - cameraUpdate: exact with the XD-named view-mode helpers
 *   (_cameraFollowUpdate, _cameraLookAtUpdate, _cameraFreeUpdate,
 *   _cameraDynamicUpdate, with the perspective helper as _cameraUpdateFov),
 *   admitted as a listed rule exception (user decision, 2026-10-03; see
 *   docs/RULE_EXCEPTIONS.md). Written in place, retail's frame differs:
 *   the NaN check slots of the first switch's two sqrtf expansions sit at
 *   76/80, above the four perspective blocks (12-72), but in-place code puts
 *   them at 12/16 (99.96%). Moving the mode 0/1-2/3/7 views into the XD-named
 *   static inlines gives exactly retail's frame, and none of them survives
 *   as a symbol (fact 3 below has the evidence and why the written
 *   sister-title clause alone did not admit them).
 * Every other function is exact.
 *
 * LINK BLOCKER STATEMENT (lane C43, 2026-09-28). Under the written policy
 * (docs/CAMPAIGN_OPERATIONS.md, "Strict acceptance policy" and
 * "Reconstructed inline helpers") this unit cannot be linked, and with it
 * cameraPlayAnime, cameraPlayOffsetAnime, cameraUpdate, cameraInit,
 * cameraSetFloorDefault, fn_80179748, cameraResetFloor, cameraSetGScamera,
 * the pad/offset updaters and the save-state handlers stay unlinked. Four
 * facts, each checked against retail:
 *
 * 1. The whole TU is the smallest linkable unit. cameraPlayAnime's chunk
 *    (0x80176C78) reads pool literals 0x8047D724 (1.0f, also read by
 *    cameraInit) and 0x8047D738 (also read by cameraUpdate and cameraInit).
 *    MWCC emits one .sdata2 pool per TU, so a carve holding cameraPlayAnime
 *    must also hold cameraInit and cameraUpdate, or read the literals through
 *    extern declarations, which is the rejected synthetic-compiler-data form
 *    (windowOpen, 7402d254). cameraInit then brings the whole .rodata
 *    section: it addresses its initializer images from the section symbol
 *    (lbl_80273D98 plus offsets), so .rodata cannot be split off or declared
 *    extern either.
 *
 * 2. .rodata needs cameraDispInfo's body, and no build or public source has
 *    it. Where we looked:
 *    - Pokemon XD JP demo map (NXXJ01.map, StarsMmd/Colo-XD-PBR-symbol-maps
 *      6b51d3af): "UNUSED 0x3EC cameraDispInfo" in camera.o and
 *      "UNUSED 0x24 dbgMenuCameraDispInfo" in dbgMenuCamera.o. Its only
 *      caller is itself stripped, so the demo DOL has no code for either.
 *    - Pokemon XD retail (TeamOrre/xd-decomp 4989794e symbols.txt,
 *      trevor403/xd-asm b1087f18): camera.o's text is contiguous from
 *      cameraSetMirrorFlag (0x80196A74, size 0x24) to cameraSetOffsetScale
 *      (0x80196A98), with no 0x3EC gap. Stripped.
 *    - Colosseum: no function refers to it. dbgMenuCameraChangeDisp
 *      (0x80006654) only opens window 6 (menuOpenCustom(6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0),
 *      then menuSetPosition(6, 20, 260)), and so does the pad camera's
 *      button 0x400. The menu-bios entry for window 6 (0x802E2DB8 + 6 * 0x1C)
 *      has no callback, so retail opens the window empty. The draw routine
 *      that filled it is the stripped one.
 *    - Pokemon Battle Revolution (Genius Sonority, Wii): its public
 *      disassemblies, pret/pokerevo ae02670e and bgsamm/pbr-dtk 09af9f9a,
 *      cover main.dol only (the GS engine), not the app code that holds
 *      camera.o. The camera names in StarsMmd's RPB*.map files are bad
 *      matches: RPBP01.map's "cameraResumeAnime" at 0x802A8F3C is
 *      WPADGetDataFormat in pbr-dtk.
 *    - Pokemon Box Ruby & Sapphire is not a Genius Sonority title (no GS
 *      engine). Pokemon Channel is Ambrella's.
 *    - GitHub code search for "cameraDispInfo", "_cameraFollowUpdate" and
 *      the format strings ("TargetOfs:(", "Field of View:(", "Near Z:(",
 *      "Far Z:(") finds nothing from these games.
 *    Without the body, the 0x160 bytes (three zero vectors and 13 format
 *    strings between cameraInit's images and the cameraWaitSyncAnime
 *    message) can only come from invented code or data. The policy rejects
 *    both: stand-in functions or data placed for pool or string order, and
 *    guessed semantics. The Melee precedent (tobj.c 0631ea73) admits a real
 *    function taken from another decomp; no decomp has this one.
 *
 * 3. cameraUpdate's frame proves inline nesting that in-place C cannot
 *    produce. MWCC (this unit's compiler and flags) gives frame slots to
 *    inlined locals by inline depth: every depth-1 local first, in source
 *    order and from the top of the frame down, then depth 2, then depth 3.
 *    Depth here means the sqrtf expansion's inner __fpclassifyf parameter
 *    (the NaN-check slot, S) and _cameraUpdateFov's four floats (P).
 *    Retail from the top of the frame down: S1=80, S2=76 (the first
 *    switch's two sqrtf), P0=60, P12=44, P3=28, P7=12 (the four view modes),
 *    S3=8 (the case-1/2 sqrtf). In-place code gives P0..P7 at depth 1 and
 *    S1..S3 at depth 2, so all four P blocks sit above S1/S2 whatever the
 *    declaration order. Writing the perspective code out (depth 0) does the
 *    same. A controlled test built all 16 subsets of {mode 0, modes 1-2,
 *    mode 3, mode 7} with that view's body in a static inline. Each subset
 *    put exactly its wrapped P blocks (and S3, when modes 1-2 are wrapped)
 *    one level deeper, as the model predicts. Only the full set gives
 *    retail's order. So retail's code has each of the four view bodies
 *    inside an inlined function, with the perspective code nested inside
 *    those. Pokemon XD retail's cameraUpdate (0x80198100, xd-asm) has the
 *    same slots: S 0x50/0x4C, P 0x3C/0x2C/0x1C/0x0C, S3 0x08.
 *    Why that evidence still does not admit the helpers under the written
 *    clauses:
 *    - Repeated expansion: none. find_inline_expansions finds each view
 *      body once, in cameraUpdate, in Colosseum and in XD alike (best other
 *      matches: _cameraOffsetAnimeUpdate at 0.72, mode 0 against mode 7 at
 *      0.66).
 *    - Listed fingerprints: none. Frame-slot order is stack allocation,
 *      which the policy rejects as sole evidence for a single-use helper.
 *    - Same-engine sister-title clause: XD names the functions only in the
 *      demo map, as UNUSED (inlined everywhere, no standalone body):
 *      _cameraFollowUpdate__FP9_GScamera 0x194,
 *      _cameraLookAtUpdate__FP9_GScamera 0x218,
 *      _cameraFreeUpdate__FP9_GScamera 0x9C,
 *      _cameraDynamicUpdate__FP9_GScamera 0x174,
 *      _cameraUpdateFov__FP9_GScamera 0x58.
 *      Compiled out of line with this unit's compiler, our bodies are
 *      _cameraUpdateFov 0x58 and mode 3 0x9C (both match XD), and
 *      mode 0 0x100, modes 1-2 0x1E0, mode 7 0x100 (XD 0x194/0x218/0x174).
 *      XD's inlined mode-3 block makes the same calls in the same order with
 *      the same arguments (its PSVECSubtract is our fn_800E0168, a GSvec
 *      wrapper around PSVECSubtract that XD inlines), but its mode 0/1-2/7
 *      blocks call PSMTX/PSVEC routines directly and do more work. So for
 *      three of the four helpers the "same calls in the same order" test
 *      fails, and none of the four has an XD function body to compare
 *      against. All four are needed (fact 3), so cameraUpdate cannot reach
 *      100% under the policy. Lane B43's research form is b734a41f.
 *
 * 4. Nothing else blocks the unit: with a real cameraDispInfo body and the
 *    four view helpers, every section is byte-identical (B43 and this lane's
 *    research builds). The decision the unit needs is outside the written
 *    policy. Either a user ruling admits the view helpers on the XD demo map
 *    plus the frame-depth proof and accepts some form for the stripped
 *    function's .rodata, or cameraPlayAnime and the rest of this TU are
 *    ported natively.
 *
 * lbl_8047D720 (30.0f) and lbl_8047D724 (1.0f) come before the float pool,
 * which is otherwise in first-use order starting with cameraSetFov's 3.0f and
 * 120.0f. MWCC places named constants defined after their uses there, so they
 * are named file-scope constants here, defined at the end.
