 * @brief FSYS slot release once every entry has settled
 *        (0x8017DAB8 - 0x8017DB74).
 *
 * fn_8017CE7C (status 2000) calls this for every load mode but 3: walk the
 * archive's entries (recording the one being looked at in
 * slot->entryIndex) and hand the slot to fn_8017D960 only when no entry's
 * trailer is still in flight, i.e. every state is 4, 6 or 7.
 *
 * Built at optimisation level 0 with peephole and scheduling on, like the
 * rest of the fsys code (see configure.py). The first state test reads
 * 0x28(entry) directly: the peephole folds "addi sub,entry,0x28;
 * lwz 0x0(sub)" for the first use only.
